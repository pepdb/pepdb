    <Property-search><![CDATA[<p class="text-justify">There are four possibilities to search for peptides by their sequence properties. It is recommended to restrict the search to relevant libraries/selections/sequencing datasets and/or to the selection or sequencing target (as defined by species/tissue/cells). Further it is possible to exclusively search among peptides that meet a minimum prominence (can be defined by maximal rank, minimal number of reads or minimal dominance).</p> 
<dl><dt>complete sequence</dt><dd><p class="text-justify">In this option the complete amino acid sequence of the peptide is entered in single-letter code. Only peptides that fit perfectly to the sequence give a positive result. It is further possible to search for sequences that show a similarity to the given sequence. To do so, enter the number of similar sequences that should be displayed as well as the minimum similarity quotient. Only peptides that meet the similarity criteria are displayed, even if their number is small as defined under number of similar sequences. The similarity quotient is determined by a comparison of sequence similarity scores utilizing the Blosum62 matrix. These scores are computed by pairwise comparison of each position in both peptides and summing up the blosum scores for each of these comparisons. The upper extreme value is "1". This value is only reachable by the query sequence itself or peptides that are longer than the query sequence and contain the whole query sequence.</p></dd>
  <dt>partial sequence</dt><dd><p class="text-justify">In this option a partial stretch of amino acids is entered in single-letter code. pepDB will try to fit the stretch to any position in the peptides that are searched.</p></dd> 
  <dt>wildcard sequence</dt><dd><p class="text-justify">In this option the complete sequence is entered, but apart from single-letter amino acids also wildcards can be used. For example “NDVRAV+” indicates all peptides that contain the sequence “NDVRAV” and have a positively charged amino acid following the second Valine.</p></dd>
  <dt>reverse wildcard search</dt><dd><p class="text-justify">In this option the complete amino acid sequence of the peptide is entered in single-letter code. pepDB translates the peptide into the wildcard alphabet used by the wildcard search, and searches for peptides that can be expressed by the combination of wildcard symbols as the query.</p></dd></dl>]]></Property-search>
    <Comparative-search><![CDATA[<p class="text-justify">The comparative search compares the peptides in one sequencing dataset with those in one or more reference datasets and can be used to determine if a peptide is specific to a certain target tissue. Use of minimum values for peptide dominance is recommended to limit processing time.</p><p class="text-justify"> The results are given as a list and contain individual specificity scores and a general specificity score. The specificity scores compare the dominance of individual peptides within the investigated dataset to the dominance of the same peptide within one reference and ranges from zero to one.</p><p class="text-justify"> A value of "1", indicates that the peptide is not present in the reference data set. A value of "0.5" indicates that the dominance in the dataset and the reference dataset are identical. A value of "0" indicates that the peptide is only found in the reference dataset.</p><p class="text-justify"> The general specificity score is determined by generating the product of the individual specificity scores and also ranges from zero to one. A high value indicates a high specificity of the peptide for the selected dataset.</p>]]></Comparative-search>
    <Motif-search><![CDATA[<p class="text-justify">The motif search allows to search in selected sequencing datasets for peptides that match with predefined sequence motifs (select a motif list) that are for example known to interact with certain surface proteins (e.g. integrins) or tissues.</p><p class="text-justify"> The motif lists contain a target (e.g. a tissue) and/or a receptor (a specific structure the peptide motif was shown to interact with) as well as a source (e.g. the PMID code of the publication in which the motif was described). Use of minimum values for peptide dominance is recommended to limit processing time.</p>]]></Motif-search>
