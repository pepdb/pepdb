    <Distinct_peptides>The number of distinct peptide sequences observed in all analyses connected to this library. It will be automatically updated by pepDB, if new sequencing data are. This value does not reflect the total number of peptides in the library, but rather the fraction that has been observed so far.</Distinct_peptides>
    <Peptide_diversity>Peptide Diversity is the estimated number of distinct peptides contained in the library, as determined by PeLiCa (http://www.pelica.org/).</Peptide_diversity>
