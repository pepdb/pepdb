This sqlite extension is designed to be a lightweight alternative to the ICU
extension implementing the REGEXP operator.

To build, just type "make"

To use, load the module. It provides the regexp operator:

	$ sqlite3 people.db
	sqlite> .load /a/b/c/regexp.sqlext
	sqlite> SELECT address FROM people WHERE name REGEXP '[Rr]ob.*';

# vim:tw=80
